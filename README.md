## Hello!

This is a site I made because I was tired of using playlists to organize music. Playlists work great for many people, but I am pretty analytical about listening to music, so I wanted data structures with more flexibility. For example, consider the following scenarios:

a) You have pop songs, and you have Chinese songs, but you want to listen to songs which are Chinese pop. 

b) You rate songs by varying levels of sadness, and at any point might want to eg. listen to all songs of sadness > 6/10. 

In situations like these, it makes sense to rate songs on a bunch of attributes, and allow playlists to be queries against these attributes rather than fixed collections of music. 

## Somewhat urgent

lots of onboarding, decide what main page is

comment out irrelevant stuff, change name, etc. add link to readme, git button


## Non-urgent additions

display alerts to user for failure conditions wrt form submissions

import from eg. spotify or other lists

try netlify or something

edit songs - search or randomize

basic css remake, esp fonts and colors

social aspect / sharing

some legend for users to remember how they want to use categories?

scroll in the attributes dropdowns

cap playlist number? select 1? etc.

## Very non-urgent

sanitize forms, yt links, etc.

saving recent/fav queries

yt search, keyword search in general? simulate yt but only if thats a good thing
