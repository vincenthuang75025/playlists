## Hello!

This is a site I made because I was tired of using playlists to organize music. Playlists work great for many people, but I am pretty analytical about listening to music, so I wanted data structures with more flexibility. For example, consider the following scenarios:

a) You have pop songs, and you have Chinese songs, but you want to listen to songs which are Chinese pop. 

b) You rate songs by varying levels of sadness, and at any point might want to eg. listen to all songs of sadness > 6/10. 

In situations like these, it makes sense to rate songs on a bunch of attributes, and allow playlists to be queries against these attributes rather than fixed collections of music. 

## Somewhat urgent

lots of onboarding, decide what main page is

comment out irrelevant stuff, etc. add link to readme, git button

logout screens for each page

## Non-urgent additions

basic css remake, esp fonts and colors

social aspect / sharing

some legend for users to remember how they want to use categories?

import from eg. spotify or other lists, but how to get attrs? ml oof

better names and descriptions for forms probably

some sort of visualization of your songs, beyond just a querier. use for listen and share

## Very non-urgent

cap playlist number? select 1? do we even want this? 

sanitize forms, yt links, etc.

saving recent/fav queries

yt search, keyword search in general? simulate yt but only if thats a good thing

scroll in the attributes dropdowns, or search? 

try netlify or something

better song updating
