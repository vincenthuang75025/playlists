## Hello!

This is a site I made because I was tired of using playlists to organize music. Playlists work great for many people, but I am pretty analytical about listening to music, so I wanted data structures with more flexibility. For example, consider the following scenarios:

a) You have pop songs, and you have Chinese songs, but you want to listen to songs which are Chinese pop. 

b) You rate songs by varying levels of sadness, and at any point might want to eg. listen to all songs of sadness > 6/10. 

In situations like these, it makes sense to rate songs on a bunch of attributes, and allow playlists to be queries against these attributes rather than fixed collections of music. 

## Somewhat urgent
