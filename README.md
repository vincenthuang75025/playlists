## Hello!

This is a site I made because I was tired of using playlists to organize music. Playlists work great for many people, but I am pretty analytical about listening to music, so I wanted data structures with more flexibility. For example, consider the following scenarios:

a) You have pop songs, and you have Chinese songs, but you want to listen to songs which are Chinese pop. 

b) You rate songs by varying levels of sadness, and at any point might want to eg. listen to all songs of sadness > 6/10. 

In situations like these, it makes sense to rate songs on a bunch of attributes, and allow playlists to be queries against these attributes rather than fixed collections of music. Feel free to contribute!

## Somewhat urgent

lots of onboarding, decide what main page is

comment out irrelevant stuff, etc. git button

logout screens for each page should look nice too

how do we explore new music? 

make things less case-sensitive to be less annoying for users

## Non-urgent additions

edit attr descriptions? 

basic css remake, esp fonts and colors

import from eg. spotify or other lists, but how to get attrs?

some sort of visualization of your songs, beyond just a querier. use for listen and share

export playlists?!? even if import is hard

## Very non-urgent

see if artist, name in search query should be top options? 

sanitize forms, yt links, etc.

import playlists

saving recent/fav queries

yt search, keyword search in general? simulate yt but only if thats a good thing

scroll in the attributes dropdowns, or search? 

try netlify or something

better song updating
